            <img src="character1.png" alt="Naruto Uzumaki is the main character in Naruto, a popular anime and manga series created by Masashi Kishimoto. He is a spirited and determined ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village, known for his distinctive spiky blond hair, blue eyes, and the iconic orange jumpsuit he wears. Naruto starts as an outcast in his village because he has the powerful Nine-Tails Fox (Kurama) sealed within him—a dangerous beast that once attacked the village.

            Despite the hardships, Naruto’s primary goal is to become the Hokage, the village’s strongest ninja and leader, to earn the villagers’ respect. He is known for his boundless energy, unwavering determination, and his never-give-up attitude. Naruto possesses unique abilities, including his iconic Shadow Clone Jutsu and, later, the Rasengan, a powerful spinning sphere of chakra.
            
            Over time, Naruto gains allies and mentors, including Kakashi Hatake, Jiraiya, and his teammates, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. His journey revolves around protecting his friends, bringing peace to the ninja world, and achieving his dream. By the end of the series, Naruto fulfills his ambitions, becomes Hokage, and establishes peace, leaving a legacy as one of the most iconic and beloved characters in anime history.">

            <img src="character2.png" alt="Sakura Haruno is one of the main characters in Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. She is a talented and determined ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village, known for her intelligence, sharp wit, and loyalty to her friends. Initially, Sakura is part of Team 7, alongside Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, under the guidance of their mentor, Kakashi Hatake.

            At the beginning of the series, Sakura is portrayed as having a crush on Sasuke and often views Naruto as annoying. However, her character grows immensely throughout the series. She initially lacks confidence in her fighting abilities but later trains under the legendary ninja Tsunade, one of the “Three Legendary Sannin.” Under Tsunade’s mentorship, Sakura becomes a skilled medical ninja, mastering superhuman strength and chakra control that make her a powerful fighter.
            
            Throughout the story, Sakura shows deep loyalty to her teammates, especially in her efforts to bring Sasuke back after he leaves the village. By the end of Naruto, Sakura matures into a confident and strong ninja who plays a crucial role in the Fourth Great Ninja War. In Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Sakura is a respected medical leader and the mother of Sarada Uchiha, who she raises with Sasuke.">

            <img src="character3.png" alt="Sasuke Uchiha is one of the primary characters in Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. A member of the Uchiha clan, one of the most powerful and respected clans in the Hidden Leaf Village, Sasuke is defined by his intense drive for revenge. As a child, he idolized his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, until the traumatic night when Itachi killed their entire clan, sparing only Sasuke. This event fuels Sasuke’s desire to become strong enough to kill his brother and restore his clan's honor.

            Sasuke is placed on Team 7 with Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, led by their teacher, Kakashi Hatake. Initially, he is a prodigious ninja with exceptional talent and skills, and his serious, cool demeanor makes him a favorite among peers, though he views friendship and bonds as weaknesses. Over time, he develops a complicated friendship and rivalry with Naruto, which becomes central to his character's development.
            
            Desperate for power, Sasuke eventually leaves the village to train under Orochimaru, a dangerous rogue ninja, aiming to gain the strength needed to defeat Itachi. He becomes entangled in darker paths, fighting against Itachi, discovering shocking truths about his family, and ultimately questioning his motives and purpose.
            
            By the end of the series, after intense battles with Naruto, Sasuke finds a new sense of purpose and redemption. He returns to the Hidden Leaf and, though still somewhat solitary, dedicates himself to protecting the village from the shadows. In Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Sasuke is a skilled warrior, husband to Sakura, and father to Sarada Uchiha, continuing his complex legacy in the ninja world.">
