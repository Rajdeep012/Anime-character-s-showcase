The Anime Character Showcase is a web-based project that highlights popular characters from the Naruto anime series, offering a brief glimpse into each character's backstory and unique powers. The interface is styled to create a dark, immersive environment, with smooth color transitions and subtle animations that draw attention to each character.

Key Features:
Navigation and Layout:

The webpage has a clear structure with a navigation bar to switch between "Home," "Characters," and "About" sections.
Each character appears in a circular thumbnail format, providing a concise visual representation with hover effects for interactive engagement.
Character Display:

Each character section includes an image with a comprehensive alt attribute serving as a mini-biography.
Hovering over characters gently scales the image, making interactions more engaging.
Animations:

The characters' images move subtly to create a dynamic feel, and background colors shift as you scroll, enhancing the overall visual experience.
JavaScript Interactivity:

A click on any character image triggers an alert displaying the character's biography, providing immediate details in a compact manner.
Responsive and Stylish Design:

The project uses a minimalist dark theme with CSS styling for smooth transitions and visual continuity.
